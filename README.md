# IBMCapstoneProject
The final two assignments for my IBM Capstone are stored in this repository.  In this project, I use Machine Learning clustering techniques to group neighborhoods from various large cities together based on their amenities in order to help people who have to move quickly choose a neighborhood that is the most comfortable and familiar to their last one.
